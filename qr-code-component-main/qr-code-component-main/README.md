My Process

Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- https://https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap/ - For text styles

What I learned
I was able to learn CSS responsiveness in this project. Also, adding googlefonts without necessarily downloading it. I did this by adding the link to my head section in HTML file and naming the font family in my CSS stylesheet. e.g
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
body{
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}

Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com - This helped me on how to use flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
This was very useful to me for understanding HTML5 and CSS custom properties. I really l recommend to check out. It's beginner friendly.
